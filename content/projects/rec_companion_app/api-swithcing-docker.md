# api switching using Docker

This is my about my project where I worked as the project lead for a club project. In this project various students worked together to make a
student companion app for our college. the issues we faced were. The few people who wanted to work on this project each had different background in development
and didn't know a single tool they all could use ( some knew node.js, some knew flask ). This made it hard to choose a tool we had to use.
As a project lead I decided to go with docker containers to host the APIs and use nginx within it to proxy the api calls to the required
So i decided on this approach so each api backend we intended to implement can be made by separate teams and once everything has been implemented we can
make it work together seemlessy.
