# Random Shit

Wow its been almost 4 years since I started my college life.
Turns out life moves fast and slow at the same time.
It always felt like I had something to do. Someone telling me what to do.
Study this, Go to this class. Now thinking about it now in a few short months.
I am gonna go out and experience freedom. No more assignments, no more exams,
no more semesters, no more praticals. hoorayy!!!
