# This is the first blog i am writing do go easy on me

## Hello world.

For the longest time i wanted to have my own blogging website.
where they can express their thoughts and ideas without any restrictions whatsoever
But our generation soley depends on socials media controlled by massive corporations
to shares their ideas where they are muted with censorship and sent into oblivion
in the name _hate speech_.

So, i encourage all of my friends to make their own blog sites and start blogging away.
Let's bring back personalized blogs.

~~Twitter~~ X and **Threads** are not cool, as they prohibit the user from speaking their thoughts as is
instead they have to muffle their ideas into a limited amount of words and reduce the usage of harsh language
like who gives a **FUCK**.

## HUGO

![HUGO](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c38c7334cc3f23585738e40334284fddcaf03d5e/2e17c/images/hugo-logo-wide.svg)

Here for this website i have used `hugo`. A is a static site generator
which makes it super easy to get it up and running as a blog site with premade theme available.
If you are like me and want to get your hands a little dirty you can make your own hugo site without any theme.
Which i might say is a considerable undertaking

# Reasons for not using React, AngularJS or other such frameworks

The reason is pretty simple you don't use a shovel to eat cereal with
while React and AngularJs provide very good platform to make webapps
the things i want to do are

- Markdown
- Write Blogs
  - rss feeder support
- Have a Gallery
  - spam pics
  - automatic convertion into webp
- use github pages
  - has its workflow

Hugo makes it very easy to do these tasks that it is a no brainer.

### Added bonus

The added bonus that comes with hugo is hugo liveserver
which makes development and testing of your webpage easy as hell.
