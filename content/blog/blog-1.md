# This is the first blog i am writing do go easy on me

## Hello world.

For the longest time i wanted to have my own blogging website.
where they can express their thoughts and ideas without any restrictions whatsoever
But our generation soley depends on socials medai controlled by massive corporations
to shares their ideas where they are muted with censorship and sent into oblivion
in the name _hate speech_.

So, i encourage all of my friends to make their own blog sites and start blogging away.
Let's bring back personalized blogs.

~Twitter~ Now X and **Threads** are not cool as they prohibit the user from speaking their mind
