# A few of my favourite quotes

> The moments that define lives aren't always obvious. They don't scream LEDGE,
> and nine times out of ten there's no rope to duck under, no line to cross, no
> blood pact, no official letter on fancy paper. They aren't always protracted,
> heavy with meaning.

            - V.E. Schwab

> “ Cowards die many times before their deaths;
> The valiant never taste of death but once.
> Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
> It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
> Seeing that death, a necessary end,
> Will come when it will come. ”

            ― William Shakespeare, Julius Caesar

> " WE SUFFER NOT FROM
> THE EVENTS IN OUR LIVES
> BUT FROM OUR
> JUDGEMENT ABOUT THEM "

            - epictetus
